# CAICForecast

Welcome to the CAIC Forecast Gem! CAIC stands for the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and is primary supported by donations. CAIC provides daily and one day look ahead forecasts of the current avalanche conditions in Colorado. During the spring season only three regions of the state receive daily forecasts. This gem will scrape the CAIC website, you will then be prompted for which region you would like the forecast from. At that point you can select the region, and the program will provide you with the forecast.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CAIC_Forecast'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CAIC_Forecast
